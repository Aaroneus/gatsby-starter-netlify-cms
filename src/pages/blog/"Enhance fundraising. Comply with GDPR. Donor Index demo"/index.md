**Donor Index delivers machine learning analytics to charities large or small**

*   Brings the power of Big Data analytics to charities as a “fundraisers' friend”.
*   Algorithms optimised for charities and fundraising.
*   Innovative interactive reporting tool for extracting fundraising insights.
*   Powerful predictive capability for long-term supporter value.

Donor Index harnesses  the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to help charities improve their fundraising performance and fundraising strategy by understanding supporters and their behaviours. The cloud-based Donor Index service ranks supporters by their expected value and also helps identify and reactivate lapsed supporters. Donor Index can also help UK charities find their most valuable supporters by region. These insights can be applied to improve segmentation accuracy and fundraising performance. Donor Index has been created using the expertise of charity analytics practice [Wood for Trees](http://www.woodfortrees.net/), part of the MyLife Digital group. With many years of providing consulting services to charities, Wood for Trees has accumulated deep knowledge of charity fundraising and segmentation performance. This expertise combines with MyLife Digital’s data science technology to deliver best practice from retail and financial services sectors to charities on a very cost-effective basis.

### **Improve your fundraising strategy with Donor Index**

The Donor Index service has been designed to be largely self-service for clients, with the ability to interrogate the AI models at any time. Once a charity’s data set has been uploaded from their charity database, and an initial model run has been performed, clients can extract insight reports from Donor Index at any time using the interactive reporting tool. A refresh run can be performed at any time to reflect changes in the data if necessary. Donor Index enables fundraisers and marketers to make better-informed strategy decisions by viewing supporter value through different lenses. These include:

*   who your supporters are
*   where your most valuable supporters live
*   and which channel recruits the best supporters for your charity

#### **Predicting fundraising performance**

Donor Index helps identify supporters beyond the common Recency, Frequency and Value (RFV) model of fundraising. Donor Index has the advantage of considering elements of a donor's profile or behaviour, relative to other donors. This helps identify hidden value in your charity database or variance on longer term prospects. With Donor Index, the predictive horizon extends out to five years, enabling long-term fundraising targets to be set.

#### **How to analyse your charity's donor database**

Charity staff don’t need to be analytical experts to be able to use Donor Index because the model provides an easy to understand score from 1 to 100, and an expected five year value per supporter. The initial model run also comes with an insights narrative report from a Wood for Trees analyst. **_We'd love to show you how this can work in more detail.

### **Donor Index and compliance with GDPR**

We can work with you to produce a Consent Audit of your database and have other products to help your organisation ensure the correct [permissions](https://consentric.io/solutions/permissions/) are collected ahead of the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) legislation deadline of May 2018. Please also see our thought leadership articles [Privacy Policies, how does yours measure up?](https://consentric.io/privacypolicies/) and [Your GDPR Checklist](https://consentric.io/gdpr-checklist/) Ensuring your Privacy Policy is updated and that you obtain the relevant consent will mean that machine learning processing does not run the risk of non-compliance. Similarly, Donor Index uses census grid information and not post codes for data augmentation. MyLife Digital Group CEO, John Hall, says

_“The combination of Wood for Trees expertise, MyLife Digital Consentric data science technology and client self-service is a powerful one and positions Donor Index with a disruptive price point in the charity sector. For the first time even small charities have cost-effective access to advanced data analytics previously only available to large organisations."_

Keith Dewar, MyLife Digital Chief Marketing Officer adds

_“We put the citizen at the heart of everything we do, and our Consentric platform is no exception. Donor Index protects supporters’ data rights by preventing the use of PII for profiling whilst delivering the predictive power of machine learning. For future inclusion of PII based on each supporter’s explicit consent, our Consentric GDPR permissions management service will be integrated with Donor Index to extend the data sets which can be ingested."_
