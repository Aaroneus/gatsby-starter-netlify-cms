Whether you’re well on the way to The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance or just starting your journey, we’ve put together a checklist to help you. Just to be sure you have everything covered. That you’ve considered all the angles. That you will be fully compliant.

With 31 boxes to tick, this GDPR Checklist certainly highlights how involved this regulation really is. But imagine how fantastic it will be to have all those boxes ticked. To feel you’re taking action. Making progress. That you’re closer to compliance.

In this checklist, we’ve given you the different elements that you need to cross off your to-do list. A practical guide not legal advice. To make sure you’ve covered all the bases.

To construct this checklist we’ve looked at lots of recent research to see what organisations are finding difficult about the regulations.

Compliance should always be the lowest common denominator and not an aspiration. So, while this checklist shows you what needs to be done, it also highlights the opportunities that will open when you embrace GDPR.
