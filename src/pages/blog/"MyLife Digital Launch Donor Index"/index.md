MyLife Digital has harnessed the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to help charities improve their understanding of supporters and their behaviours. The cloud-based Donor Index service provides rankings of supporters’ expected value. These insights can be applied to improve segmentation accuracy and fundraising performance. Donor Index has been created using the expertise of charity analytics practice Wood for Trees, part of the MyLife Digital group. With many years of providing consulting services to charities, Wood for Trees has accumulated deep knowledge of charity fundraising and segmentation performance. This expertise combines with MyLife Digital’s data science technology to deliver best practice from retail and financial services sectors to charities on a very cost-effective basis.
