According to a report conducted by [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/dk-en/_acnmedia/PDF-39/Accenture-PoV-Dynamic-Consumers.pdf) nearly all (87%) of consumers believe it is important for them to be able to review and control their personal data online. However, 75% do not find it easy to manage that data. That’s why we believe in ensuring that customers can view and manage their personal data permissions status, simply and efficiently. The Consentric Digital Widget can be embedded across any digital customer touchpoint, putting you in total control of what information is presented. Ultimately, this will empower individuals and improve trust in an organisations brand.

### What is the Consentric Digital Widget?

The Digital Widget is simple. It’s a link embedded in an authenticated app (e.g. Preference Centre or Online Account) or a secure link in an e-mail (e.g. e-mail unsubscribes). It has been developed to surface permissions and preference updates directly on an organisation’s website or at any touch point in the digital journey; environments your customers would be familiar with. Any updates customers make to their permissions or preferences within the widget will be reflected in their Consentric record, and a full audit log of changes will be recorded. To see the power of the full Consentric platform [click here](https://consentric.io/book-a-demo/). There are just two simple steps to using the Digital Widget:

1.  Embedding the Widget onto your website or app; and
2.  Giving customers access to manage their own preferences

### Embedding the Digital Widget

It’s a very simple process to get the digital widget up and running on your website or digital application. The digital widget code includes simple configuration to make preference or permission management available to customers and capture the appropriate privacy policy and statement displayed to the customer. Placing a simple script detailing the ID’s of the permissions (personal data held, purposes it is used for and who is using the data), statement and privacy policy into a website will instantly display within the Digital Widget on the site (within an iframe hosted on Consentric servers). The Digital Widget was developed with a non-intrusive design to make it fit elegantly across different websites and colour schemes.

### Giving Customers Access

Citizens are given access to manage their permissions by a unique, time-limited secure access token, eliminating the need for easily forgettable usernames and passwords. These tokens are either created on demand or embedded into links within e-mails which, when clicked, direct citizens to your customer website where the Digital Widget is displayed. No need for passwords. Once a citizen has updated their choices they will be immediately saved to their Consentric record. **Discover more on the Digital Widget and the Full Consentric platform & [Book a Demo](https://consentric.io/book-a-demo/)**
