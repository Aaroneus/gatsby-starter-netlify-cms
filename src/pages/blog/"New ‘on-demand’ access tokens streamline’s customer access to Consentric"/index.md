_Our new ‘on-demand’ access tokens expand the ways you can use the Consentric Digital Widget to give your customers access to view and update their permissions.  It provides an opportunity for the Widget to be integrated in new areas facilitating a more streamlined user journey which is paramount to any engagement strategy, which in turn builds customer trust in an organisations brand._ In one of our previous feature articles, we highlighted the [Consentric Digital Widget](https://consentric.io/digital-widget-loop/). It helps build trust with customers by giving them control over their personal data, allowing them to manage and update their consents, preferences and permissions across any digital touchpoint of an organisation such as a website or digital app. Crucially, to enable secure access to this consumer-centric interface, the widget relies on a secure access token (a unique random complex string of numbers and letters) that has been issued by Consentric.  We have now developed this process to become even more seamless.

### How do Tokens work?

In the past, tokens had to be generated in batches, a system that worked, and continues to work incredibly effectively for many of our Consentric users. However, we received feedback from some clients that the ability to create individual user tokens as and when they are needed would be a valuable new feature. The introduction of ‘on demand’ access tokens allows an organisation to generate an access token almost immediately for a specified citizen.  A common use case for ‘on demand’ access tokens is to enable organisations to simply embed the Consentric Digital Widget into their authenticated website or app.  When the citizen then wants to view and update their consents, preferences and permissions an ‘On-demand access token’ can be generated in near real-time to provide secure access to the widget. This new ‘on demand’ access token feature is now available on Consentric.

### How do ‘on-demand’ access tokens deliver value?

According to a report conducted by [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/dk-en/_acnmedia/PDF-39/Accenture-PoV-Dynamic-Consumers.pdf) nearly all (87%) of consumers believe it is important for them to be able to review and control their personal data online. However, 75% do not find it easy to manage that data. The ‘on demand’ access token, allows a simpler pattern of development and maintenance, ensuring that the interaction they have with your organisation is as transparent and positive as possible. It means a more streamlined user journey which is paramount to any engagement strategy, which in turn builds customer trust in an organisations brand.
