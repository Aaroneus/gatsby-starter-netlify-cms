Earlier this year we sent three of our dedicated colleagues on a trip to Helsinki, to present at MyData 2017. We've talked about it (a bit!) so this won't come as a huge surprise, but we are passionate at MyLife Digital about the opportunities the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will bring. Organisations need to embrace the changes - those that do will reap the benefits, as will their customers. Click on the links below to see the presentations by: [Karen Watson - GDPRÂ the latest everybody must have](https://youtu.be/4VlDQnxLHRk) [Simon Crossley - Building a Population Scale API](https://youtu.be/DExs6sVoq_Q) [Ruaridh Thomson - Artificial Intelligence and Consent](https://youtu.be/QETpxMi3Fgo) Break out the popcorn and enjoy!
