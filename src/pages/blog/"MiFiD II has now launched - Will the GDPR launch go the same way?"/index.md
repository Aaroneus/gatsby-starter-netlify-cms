As with any significant legislation change, people will have their say and opinions. The MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II) deadline came and went on the 3rd January 2018. Sophie Guibaud, VP of European Expansion at Fidor Bank spoke to BobsGuide Reporter David Beach, “MiFID II is a key piece of European-wide legislation. This regulation, along with the incoming GDPR piece of legislation, means that financial organisations will be looking at immediate options to help them decrease their regulatory risk and costs, while also improving the customer experience this year. The new regulations will have a huge effect as financial organisations’ relationships with regulators will rely upon real-time data to be shared to improve and speed up risk management and market stability, all through the power of APIs.” The concerns, challenges and expectations from various industry leaders have been collated by BobsGuide and the full article can be found via [this link](http://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2018/Jan/4/has-the-financial-services-landscape-already-changed-following-mifid-ii-implementation/). So, is this a taste of things to come in May when the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) finally lands after two years in the making? Will organisations be better prepared for the change from the Data Protection Act? We'd like to think so, but the clock is ticking. The GDPR replaces the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and has been designed to:

*   harmonise data privacy laws across the EU
*   protect and empower all EU citizens data privacy
*   reshape the way organisations across the region approach data privacy.

To empower EU Citizens, wherever they reside, the legislation provides the following rights when it comes to their personal data:

1.  The right to be informed
2.  The right of access
3.  The right to rectification
4.  The right to erase
5.  The right to restrict processing
6.  The right to data portability
7.  The right to object
8.  Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.

Organisations need to take a number of steps to be transparent when it comes to the collection, storage and use of their customers' data. For a start, they must have a valid lawful basis in order to process personal data. There are six lawful bases for processing, but no single basis is deemed as better, or more important, than another – the basis an organisation selects as the most appropriate to use will depend upon their relationship with the customer and the purpose for processing the data. The lawful basis for processing can also affect which rights are available to customers. For example:

**Lawful Basis**

**Definition of Lawful Basis**

**Right to erasure**

**Right to portability**

**Right to****object**

**Consent**

Clear consent has been given by the customer for the organisation to process personal data for a specific purpose

Yes

Yes

No – but right to withdraw consent

**Contract**

Personal data processing is necessary for a contract between the organisation and the customer, or the customer has asked you to take specific steps to proceed whilst entering into a contract

Yes

Yes

No

**Legal obligation**

Processing is necessary to comply with the law (but not including contractual obligations – see Contract above)

No

No

No

**Vital interests**

The processing of personal data is necessary to protect a person's life

Yes

No

No

**Public task**

Personal data needs to be processed during a task which is in the public interest or for official functions. The task or function must have a clear basis in law

No

No

Yes

**Legitimate interests**

Processing is necessary for an organisations legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party, unless there is good reason to protect the customers personal data – which overrides those legitimate interests. (this does not apply to public authorities processing data to perform official tasks – see Public task above)

Yes

No

Yes

This table is based on guidance from the ICO. For more information from the [Information Commissioners Office click here](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/) We have written a white paper - Trust in the Digital Age, that discusses four key points organisations must address to ensure they maintain their market share and strengthen engagement with the individuals whose data they hold, these being - trust, transparency, privacy and security. It also brings together some principal research in these areas, research that led to the development of our [Consentric Platform](https://consentric.io/solutions/consentric-platform/), which places the customer's trust at the heart of an organisations data protection and GDPR strategy.
