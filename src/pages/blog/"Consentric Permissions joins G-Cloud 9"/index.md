UK public sector organisations can now procure MyLife Digital’s trusted GDPR permissions management services through the G-Cloud framework on the Digital Marketplace. In enabling public sector and nonprofit organisations to achieve GDPR compliance, the Consentric Permissions service puts citizens in control of their personal data and what can be done with it. The new GDPR data protection legislation comes into force in less than 12 months from now and many organisations face challenges to be ready in time. These challenges are particularly acute with regard to managing citizens’ consents and permissions for organisations’ use of their personal data under the new legislation. The cloud-based Consentric Permissions service has been designed from the ground up to support organisations in doing this. In addition to GDPR, the new Digital Economy Act 2017 which became law in April makes it easier for Government departments and other public-sector bodies to share citizens’ data with one another. While this delivers many benefits for the UK economy and society, the data sharing aspects have created more privacy concerns at a time when citizens’ trust in online experiences is already in decline. MyLife Digital’s Consentric Permissions service is the first truly citizen-centric data sharing consent management service to address this issue. MyLife Digital Group CEO, John Hall, says “The G-Cloud framework is a very important marketplace for us. As a challenger brand in the new personal data economy, being awarded a place on G-Cloud 9 gives our customers assurance that our services meet the stringent information security management requirements set by the UK Government.” Keith Dewar, MyLife Digital Chief Marketing Officer adds “We put the citizen at the heart of everything we do, and our Consentric platform is no exception. Designed for population-scale deployments, it provides data protection officers, contact centre staff and digital teams in organisations with everything they need to be compliant with GDPR permissions regulations. On the citizen side, it enables individuals to directly manage their personal data permissions, engaging them more deeply and building trust”.
