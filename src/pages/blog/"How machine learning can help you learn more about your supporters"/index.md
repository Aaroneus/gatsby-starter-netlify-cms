On the 5th June we held a useful, and enlightening, webinar for the Charity and Non-Profit sector. James Londal - Director of Data Science, Keith Dewar - Group Marketing and Product Director for MyLife Digital Group and Jon Kelly - Director of Analysis for Wood for Trees presented an overview of machine learning andÂ a demo of Donor Index, a solution specifically for the charity sector based on years of experience in data analysis and modelling.
