Whether you are a citizen or an organisation - chances are the new Data Protection regulation will apply to you (If you are a citizen of the EU or an organisation who holds personal data of EU citizens) So, have a think about what matters to you about personal data - who you share it with, how you use it, what you provide and what you'd like as value in exchange.
