25th May 2018 - GDPR Day is justÂ eight months away. Are you ready? Start by asking yourself these five questions about data processing in your organisation:

*   **W**hat personal data is being processed?
*   **W**hy is the personal data being processed, for which of the six legal justifications?
*   **W**ho/Which organisation or department can process that data for the given purpose(s)?
*   **W**here (and how) was the relevant permission captured from the citizen?
*   **W**hen was the relevant permission captured from the citizen?

If you have all the answers, great. If you need some assistance with the management of personal data, our Consentric Permissions can help by connecting your organisation to every individual. Empowering them to control their personal data and provide the consent needed for their information to be used for specified purposes. https://consentric.io/book-a-demo/
