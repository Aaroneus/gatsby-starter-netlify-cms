On 19th October MyLife Digital sponsored, and supported, the [Together We're Better Conference](https://www.togetherwerebetter.org.uk/) at Bounce Ping Pong in Farringdon. Together We're better brings together not-for-profits, start-ups, the public sector and commercial bodies to collaborate, learn and fuel ideas around disruption, the change agenda and what this means across sectors. Our Practice CEO, [J Cromack](https://twitter.com/JCCromack) presents ["Not enough love and digital understanding](https://www.togetherwerebetter.org.uk/resources/giving-citizens-their-personal-data-rights-back)" which addresses the issues organisations face with a lose of trust - especially when it comes to personal data use.Â  And, how we all need to champion citizens digital rights and help them gain a true digital understanding of what happens to their data once they provide it online.
