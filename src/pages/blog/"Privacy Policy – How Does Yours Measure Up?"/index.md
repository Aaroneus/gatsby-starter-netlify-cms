In response to the Information Commissioner’s Office ruling on charities breaching the Data Protection Act, MyLife Digital, together with Wood for Trees, have undertaken research to assess the areas of weakness in the Privacy Policies of numerous charities when it comes to to personal data. The research is based upon analysis of 45 UK-based charities' Privacy Policies, in an attempt to see how they correspond with current data protection regulations and in preparation for the impending EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes in to force May 2018.
